            I am interested in game design and developement. In particular I'm interested in analyzing what makes a game fun. I am also interested in data science, particularly machine learning.
        </p>
        <p> In my spare time I like reading books. I love all genres and see value in reading anything from Raph Koster's "A Theory of Fun for Game Design" to Joseph Campbell's "A Hero with a Thousand Faces", anything from "Harry Potter" to Victor Hugo's
            "Les Mis√©rables", anything from american comics to japanese manga to textbooks on interesting subjects.

            I consider myself to be a team player and I believe, that I have good communication skills. I more often than not am able to stay calm in stressful situations. I tend to always finish what I start, and since I love trying new things I am willing to learn
            and work hard. I tend to get nervous around new people, but when I get to know everyone we usually get along pretty well.
